            <h2><span class="text-primary">FASHION</span> trend forecast</h2>
            <p>Emerging trends from catwalk and streetstyle images are captured in super-visual and stimulating FASHION
                forecasting reports. These take the form of highly effective mood boards, which translate the
                overarching themes of the season into actionable design ideas. The process involves extensive analysis
                of catwalk and streetstyle images to highlight new ideas for apparel and accessory designs.</p>

            <h3>The Daileigh</h3>

            <p>The Daileigh’s Ashleigh Hutchinson wants her readers to build their perfect closet. She aims to help
                women of all ages find or create a style they love. In particular, Ashleigh wants older women to feel
                confident in their own style. She wants to break the assumption that some trends are suited only to a
                particular age group. Ashleigh’s philosophy centers around the notion that “age is only a number.”</p>

            <h3>Egg Canvas</h3>
            <p>The whimsically named Egg Canvas is the brainchild of Erica Choi, a design director and photographer
                based in New York.
                Why the name “Egg Canvas”? Erica was inspired by her Korean childhood nickname, which means egg, while
                “canvas” is the medium with which art is created. “Egg Canvas,” therefore, is her life—creating
                beautiful things each day on a blank canvas.
                A licensed esthetician and graphic design graduate, Erica has a discerning eye for visuals. The posts on
                Egg Canvas have beautiful photos that are accompanied by short texts.
                The blog includes a section showcasing the latest New York Fashion Week as well as a guide around NYC.

            <h3>The Fashion Guitar</h3>
            <p>The Fashion Guitar is the online blog of Dutch-born Charlotte Groeneveld-Van Haren. Now based in New
                York, she is a mother of two and runs her blog full-time.
                Charlotte had worked with fashion blogs in one of her former jobs until she decided to create one
                herself. As a personal style blog, The Fashion Guitar showcases Charlotte’s own fashion sense. When she
                became a mother, the posts naturally featured her maternity and motherhood style, and it became a
                significant part of the website. Charlotte has worked with her favorite brands and designers, and loves
                collaborating with them.</p>
